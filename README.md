LUA BRIDGE TO GLIB ASYNCHRONOUS
===============================

This module expose some GLib asynchronous methods to be used in Lua. It exists
to work around obscure bugs found in the current LGI binding and use some
asynchronous method not exposed by GObject-introspection.

This version is pre-alpha and not very useful yet.
